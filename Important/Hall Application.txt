The Provost
Sher-e-Bangla Hall

Subject: Application for allotting a seat in the attached hall

Sir,
With due respect, I, Md. Akhtaruzzaman, would like to state that my son, Md. Maniruzzaman Mridul(Student ID-2405029) is currently studying in your institution in CSE Department Level-1/Term-1.He is attached to the hall currently. As a responsible guardian I humbly request you to allocate a seat in the attached hall for my child due to severe financial and logistical difficulties. Currently, my child resides in Shahbagh, which is a current hotzone for protestors and the mess also lacks basic amenities like constant water supply, ongoing load-shedding problems and large mill expenses. He has to go through a lot of hardship throughout the day travelling in this busy city. Irregular meals due to high costs and unhygienic living conditions are affecting my childâ€™s health and academic focus.

A seat in his hall would ensure affordable and secure accommodation, provide access to clean food, water, and electricity, reduce transportation burdens and risks.

I, therefore, pray and hope that you would consider this cry for help and provide my son with a seat in the Sher-e-Bangla Hall.

Sincerely
Md. Akhtaruzzaman
