generate a case solving with divisibility where 5 student from a 1-30 roll in a class, one of them have given a proxy for another student. now 4 of them is lying and there's an imposter for the teacher who will only tell the truth, but he wont directly say who is lying


The truthful student’s roll number is the smallest possible value that satisfies all previous clues

In a class of 30 students (roll numbers 1-30), 5 students are involved in a proxy situation:

One student has given a proxy for another student (i.e., signed attendance on their behalf).

Among these 5 students:

4 are lying about their involvement.

1 is telling the truth (the truthful student).

There is an imposter among these 5 students (not the teacher). The imposter:

Always tells the truth (unlike the other 4 liars).

Won’t directly say who is lying but provides clues.

The imposter gives the following clues:

"The sum of our 5 roll numbers is divisible by 5."

"The sum of the 4 lying students' roll numbers is divisible by 4."

"The truthful student’s roll number is greater than the proxy giver’s roll number."
